Game instructions: Sushi Ninja is a game where you get 50 points for every sushi piece you hit. If you get to 500 points you win. Beware of the ninja stars coming at you though! If you get hit three times by any ninja stars, it is game over. Tap or slide your cursor around the screen to get as much sushi as you can while avoiding the ninja stars.
